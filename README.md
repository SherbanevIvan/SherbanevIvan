Ivan, 16 years old  

Python programmer with experience in Arduino projects. Although I haven't built large-scale projects independently, I have focused extensively on olympiad programming and robotics. Iâ€™ve also gained preliminary experience working with ROS, SSH, and antenna systems. Always eager to learn and take on new challenges in software development and embedded systems.
